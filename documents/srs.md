## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the requirements for the AI Interview Simulator, an interactive, AI-powered platform to help users prepare for job interviews by simulating realistic interview scenarios, providing customized questions, evaluating responses, and offering constructive feedback.

### 1.2 Scope
The AI Interview Simulator will provide:
- Text-based interview simulation
- Customizable interview environments (job role, job description, difficulty, number of questions)
- Performance evaluation and feedback
- Session history and progress tracking (for logged-in users)
- User authentication (username/password)

Potential future enhancements include voice interaction and more advanced customization.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence
- **LLM**: Large Language Model
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
- **UI**: User Interface

### 1.4 Overview
This document describes the systemâ€™s intended features, constraints, and interfaces, and serves as a basis for development and validation.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The AI Interview Simulator is currently a standalone web application built with Streamlit. It utilizes Python modules for core functionalities like question generation, evaluation, and database interactions. The long-term vision includes refactoring into a microservice backend architecture.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- User authentication (signup, login, logout)
- Role/interview configuration (job role, description, difficulty, number of questions)
- Dynamic question generation
- Real-time answer evaluation
- Feedback delivery (immediate or delayed)
- Session management and progress tracking (view past interviews and results)
- Database storage for user accounts and interview history

Optional voice and video interaction are planned for future phases.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Job Seekers**: Individuals preparing for interviews

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Web-based application (Streamlit)
- Desktop and mobile browsers
- Cloud-based backend (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Current: Monolithic Streamlit application with modular Python components.
- Future: Microservice architecture.
- LLM integration via API (handled by backend modules).
- Compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)

### 2.6 User Documentation
- User manual
- Online help and FAQs
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast and adjustable text size

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Reliable internet connection
- Availability of LLM provider APIs
- Cloud infrastructure for deployment
