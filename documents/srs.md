## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the requirements for the AI Interview Simulator, an interactive, AI-powered platform to help users prepare for job interviews by simulating realistic interview scenarios, providing customized questions, evaluating responses, and offering constructive feedback.

### 1.2 Scope
The AI Interview Simulator will provide:
- Text-based interview simulation (with potential for voice interaction)
- Customizable interview environments
- Performance evaluation and feedback
- Session history and progress tracking

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence
- **LLM**: Large Language Model
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
- **UI**: User Interface

### 1.4 Overview
This document describes the systemâ€™s intended features, constraints, and interfaces, and serves as a basis for development and validation.
