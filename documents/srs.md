## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the requirements for the AI Interview Simulator, an interactive, AI-powered platform to help users prepare for job interviews by simulating realistic interview scenarios, providing customized questions, evaluating responses, and offering constructive feedback.

### 1.2 Scope
The AI Interview Simulator will provide:
- Text-based interview simulation
- Customizable interview environments (job role, job description, difficulty, number of questions)
- Performance evaluation and feedback
- Session history and progress tracking (for logged-in users)
- User authentication (username/password)

Potential future enhancements include voice interaction and more advanced customization.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence
- **LLM**: Large Language Model
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
- **UI**: User Interface

### 1.4 Overview
This document describes the systemâ€™s intended features, constraints, and interfaces, and serves as a basis for development and validation.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The AI Interview Simulator is a standalone web application built with Streamlit. It uses Python modules for question generation, evaluation, and database interactions. All logic is contained in a monolithic Streamlit app, with session state managed by Streamlit and persistent data stored in a local SQLite database.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- User authentication (signup, login, logout)
- Interview configuration (job role, job description, difficulty, number of questions)
- Dynamic question generation (via LLM)
- Real-time answer evaluation and feedback (via LLM)
- Session management and progress tracking (view past interviews and results)
- Database storage for user accounts and interview history

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Job Seekers**: Individuals preparing for interviews

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Web-based application (Streamlit)
- Desktop and mobile browsers
- Local or cloud-hosted SQLite backend

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Monolithic Streamlit application with modular Python components
- LLM integration via API (handled by backend modules)
- Accessibility: basic Streamlit accessibility features

### 2.6 User Documentation
- User manual
- Online help and FAQs

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Reliable internet connection
- Availability of LLM provider APIs

## 3. System Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Interview Setup
- Users can input job role and job description.
- Users can configure interview difficulty and number of questions.

#### 3.1.2 Interview Simulation
- System generates questions dynamically based on configuration.
- Real-time analysis of user responses.
- Support for free-form text input.
- Users can navigate between answered questions to review responses and feedback.

#### 3.1.3 Feedback System
- Real-time evaluation of answers during the interview.
- Scoring of responses.
- Identification of strengths and areas for improvement.
- Constructive feedback and sample ideal answers.
- Overall performance analysis after completing all questions.

#### 3.1.4 Session Management
- User accounts with signup and login.
- Session history storage for logged-in users.
- Ability to view past interview details and overall performance.
- Progress tracking through a dashboard displaying completed interviews.

#### 3.1.5 Advanced Features (Optional/Future)
- Voice interaction (speech input/output, tone analysis)
- Video analysis (facial expression, body language)
- Personalized coaching and improvement plans

### 3.2 Non-functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Performance
- Low response time (subject to LLM API latency)
- Support for multiple users (within Streamlit session limits)

#### 3.2.2 Security
- Encrypted password storage (hashed in SQLite)
- Privacy-preserving data handling

#### 3.2.3 Reliability
- High uptime (subject to hosting platform)
- Error logging

#### 3.2.4 Scalability
- Limited by Streamlit and SQLite; not horizontally scalable in current form

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces
- Streamlit-based responsive UI
- Progress indicators, feedback scoring, and dashboards

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
- None (web-based, standard devices)

### 4.3 Software Interfaces
- LLM provider API (abstracted by Python modules)
- Local SQLite database for user and interview data storage
- Authentication via username and password

### 4.4 Communication Interfaces
- HTTPS for all client-server and API communications (if deployed on secure hosting)

---

## 5. Other Requirements

- Agile development methodology
- Unit and integration testing
  - Comprehensive test suite using Python's unittest framework
  - Test coverage for core modules (database, question generation, evaluation)
  - Automated test execution via `python3 -m unittest discover -v`
  - Mock testing for LLM API dependencies
- Continuous integration and deployment (if configured)
- Regular maintenance and updates

## 6. Appendix

### 6.1 Sample Question Banks
- Software Engineering, Product Management, Data Science etc.

### 6.2 Evaluation Rubrics
- Technical accuracy, communication, problem-solving, professional presence

### 6.3 Data Model (Current Implementation)
- **users** table: id, username, email, password_hash, created_at
- **interviews** table: id, user_id, job_role, job_description, difficulty, questions (JSON), responses (JSON), feedback (JSON), overall_feedback (JSON), overall_score, created_at
  - questions: JSON array of question strings
  - responses: JSON array of user answer strings (or null)
  - feedback: JSON array of objects with score, strengths, areas_for_improvement, sample_answer
